# CZ1007 Data Structures

Covered C programming language and basic data structures (e.g. arrays, stacks, queues, binary trees)

Only have the lab/course work for the first few weeks. Couldn't find the rest of it lol. Also, take note that I took this module during AY19-20S2, syllabus has been updated since then (from what I know). Use at your own discretion.
