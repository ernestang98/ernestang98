5. Click on the "Continue" button
6. Click on the "Back" button to make another query
7. Repeat steps 2-5

<br>How to add more dna sequences:
<br>Add the fna file into the genome_seq folder. It'll automatically appear in the interface.
<br>Note: Our interface can only handle fna files with a single sequence record
