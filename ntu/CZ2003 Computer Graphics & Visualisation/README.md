# CZ2003 Computer Graphics & Visualisation

Covered the fundamentals of computer graphics and geometry rendering.

Worst module I've taken in NTU thus far. Did not do well and hence, reference at your own discretion.

Used a mixture of both VRML/FVRML and ShapeExplorer across 5 labs.

1. `.wrl` files are submissions done in VRML/FVRML

2. `.Func` files are submissions done with ShapeExplorer
