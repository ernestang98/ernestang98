# CZ2006 Software Engineering

Covered the various stages of a typical Software Development Lifecycle.

The project required teams to develop an application using either data.gov.sg's suite of APIs or Google's suite of APIs. My team developed [SickGoWhere](https://github.com/ernestang98/sickgowhere), a medical facility locatator with an appointment booking system using Google Maps API.
