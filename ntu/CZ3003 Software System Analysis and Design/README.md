# CZ3003 Software System Analysis and Design

Covered software architectures, various design patterns and system design

The project required teams to develop an application which aims to gamify learning and education (need to use game engine). My team developed [Game of Thrones](https://github.com/ernestang98/game-of-thrones), a MMORPG-based learning platform built using Unity3D.
