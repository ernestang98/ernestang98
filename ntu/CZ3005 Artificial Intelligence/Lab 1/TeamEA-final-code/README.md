**To run a specific task, execute the following on the terminal/command prompt: `(python3 main.py --task TaskNumber)`, where TaskNumber represents the task number**

```bash
python main.py --task 1
python main.py --task 2
python main.py --task 3
```



**To run all tasks, execute the following on the terminal/command prompt:**

```bash
python3 main.py
```



### Note:

- Ensure that "Task1.py", "Task2.py", "Task3.py", "Coord.json", "Cost.json", "Dist.json" and "G.json" files are in the same directory as the "main.py" file that is being executed.
- The code should work on Python 3.6 and above.
