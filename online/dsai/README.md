### Debugging Issues for Jupyter Notebook

- [Miniconda, Anaconda, Conda](https://towardsdatascience.com/get-your-computer-ready-for-machine-learning-how-what-and-why-you-should-use-anaconda-miniconda-d213444f36d6)

- [No module found errors even after pip installing](https://towardsdatascience.com/importerror-no-module-named-xyz-45e4a5339e1b)
  
  On Juptyter Notebook:

  ```python
  import sys
  sys.path
  ```

  Then find the python path Jupyter notebook uses and `/path/to/python3 -m pip install MODULE`

### Datasets for tutorials

- Folders with `.gitignore` have the ignored datasets which are too large to upload to git, am looking into uploading it online, will update soon
